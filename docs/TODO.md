# Dhruva OS — open backlog

Effort buckets are relative to this project's own established
"round" cadence (see git log / project memory — one round is
typically one focused, fully-verified unit of work: build, full
self-test + `phase4_milestone.py` battery, `heap_stress.py`/
`power_yank.py`, commit). S/M/L/XL below is sized against that unit,
not calendar time.

## Storage & USB portability (Pi 4 / Pi 5 / Compute Module)

See `docs/PORTING.md` for the full writeup this backlog references.

- **Block-device abstraction for the FS layer** — `[S, ~1 round —
  DONE, round 36]`
  Replaced the FS layer's 8 real direct `sdhost_read_block`/
  `sdhost_write_block` call sites (`fs_init`/`fs_append_raw`/`fs_find_
  latest_block_raw`/`fs_compact`/`fs_read_raw` — more than the
  original ~5 estimate once actually counted; the SD driver's own
  8-block self-test sweep deliberately still calls SDHOST directly,
  since its whole point is testing that peripheral specifically) with
  calls through `fs_block_read`/`fs_block_write`. Not a function-
  pointer/vtable interface as originally envisioned here — no evidence
  vani supports storing a callable function value persistently across
  calls the way this project's own `extern "C"` state-accessor pattern
  needs, so a simple `fs_state`-backed integer selector (0=SDHOST,
  1=USB mass storage) with an `if`/`else` dispatch was used instead,
  matching this codebase's own established mutually-exclusive-`if`
  state-dispatch style elsewhere (`ifconfig`'s DHCP state print,
  `netstat`'s TCP state names). Same functional outcome, simpler and
  provably within the language's actual capabilities. SDHOST remains
  the permanent default (`.bss` zero-init) — zero behavior change for
  every real FS operation, confirmed by the full existing battery.
  USB mass storage proved as a genuine second backend through this
  same abstraction (see the USB mass storage item below).
  Unblocks: EMMC2 (needs Pi 4 hardware regardless) and NVMe, whenever
  either is actually built — same abstraction, a new backend behind it.

- **EMMC2 block driver (Pi 4 storage)** — `[M, ~2-3 rounds]`
  New low-level driver for BCM2711's EMMC2 controller, implementing
  the block-device interface above. Needs real Pi 4 hardware (or a
  fully accurate emulator, which QEMU does not currently offer at
  this project's needed fidelity) to verify — loses the pure-QEMU
  verification loop the project has used for every round so far.
  Depends on: block-device abstraction (above).

- **XHCI USB host controller driver (Pi 4/5 USB 3.x)** — `[XL,
  several rounds — the largest single item in this backlog]`
  A new driver from scratch for the XHCI class (VL805 on Pi 4, RP1 on
  Pi 5) — ring-based command/event/transfer queues, a materially
  larger enumeration state machine than DWC2's. The existing
  mass-storage/network device-class handling built on top of DWC2's
  enumeration needs re-plumbing on top of this, not just a driver
  swap underneath it. Connector type (Type-A/micro/C) is not a
  software concern — only the host controller silicon matters.
  Real-hardware bring-up required; no QEMU safety net available.

## New capability roadmap (Pi 1, buildable and regression-testable under QEMU now)

Unlike the storage/USB portability section above, these three don't
need new hardware to build OR verify — they deepen subsystems this
project already targets on Pi 1, and QEMU's fidelity is sufficient for
the whole build-and-regress loop this project has used every round so
far. Expect each to span multiple rounds/sessions, same as any
multi-round item elsewhere in this backlog.

- **USB mass storage class driver** — `[L, ~4-6 rounds — DONE (rounds
  33-36); see scope note below on what "done" does and doesn't mean]`
  Today's DWC2 driver does enumeration only (`GET_DESCRIPTOR`,
  `SET_ADDRESS`, `SET_CONFIGURATION`) — "no bulk or interrupt
  transfers, control only" per the driver's own comment. A real
  prerequisite, not optional: bulk transfer support has to land in the
  DWC2 driver first (a materially different endpoint/transfer-type
  path than control transfers), before Bulk-Only Transport (CBW/CSW)
  and a minimal SCSI subset can be built on top. Fully QEMU-testable
  throughout — `-device usb-storage` (already used every round for
  enumeration regression) emulates a real BOT+SCSI device, so
  bring-up and regression don't need to wait for real hardware.
  - Done (round 33): config-descriptor parsing now actually extracts
    (not just counts) bulk endpoint address/max-packet-size for a
    detected Mass Storage/SCSI/BOT interface (class 0x08/subclass
    0x06/protocol 0x50); `dwc2_bulk_out`/`dwc2_bulk_in` primitives with
    correct generic (non-control) PID/data-toggle tracking, persistent
    per endpoint; CBW/CSW framing and a live `TEST UNIT READY` round
    trip, verified against QEMU's real `usb-storage` backend (correctly
    reproduced a genuine SCSI Unit Attention on the first command, GOOD
    status on retry — also exercising toggle tracking across a second
    transfer). `usb-net` enumeration confirmed completely unaffected
    (gated on the BOT interface actually being present).
  - Done (round 34): factored the CBW-out/data-in/CSW-in shape into a
    generic `usb_msd_scsi_command_in` (rule of three, once a third
    near-identical call site appeared); added `INQUIRY` (real 36-byte
    data-in stage, the first this driver exercises) and
    `READ CAPACITY(10)` (8-byte data-in, both fields big-endian —
    SCSI's own wire convention, distinct from and easy to confuse with
    the BOT wrapper's little-endian CBW/CSW fields). Live-verified
    against QEMU's real `usb-storage` backend with independently
    checkable ground truth: `INQUIRY` returned the real "QEMU"/"QEMU
    HARDDISK" vendor/product strings, `READ CAPACITY(10)` returned
    last_lba=0x3FFF/block_len=0x200 — exactly matching a fresh 8MB
    backing image (16384 × 512 = 8388608 bytes). `usb-net` confirmed
    still completely unaffected.
  - Done (round 35): added a new dedicated 512-byte `usb_bulk_data_
    scratch` (not a resize of the shared 64-byte `dwc2_dma_scratch`,
    which still backs control transfers unchanged) and pointed
    `dwc2_bulk_out`/`dwc2_bulk_in` at it, raising their cap from 64 to
    512 bytes. Generalized round 34's `usb_msd_scsi_command_in` into
    `usb_msd_scsi_command` (added an `is_write` direction) once
    `WRITE(10)`'s OUT data stage needed the same shape as `READ(10)`'s
    IN. Added `usb_msd_read10`/`usb_msd_write10` and a live round-trip
    check (write a real pattern to LBA 100, read it back, byte-compare
    via the SAME `test_fill_pattern`/`test_compare_buffers` helpers the
    SD driver's own round-trip sweep uses). Worked first try.
    Verified at the strongest level available: read the QEMU backing
    image file directly from the host at byte offset 100×512 and
    confirmed it holds the real, persisted pattern — not just an
    in-session round trip, a genuinely durable sector write. `usb-net`
    confirmed still completely unaffected.
  - Done (round 36): built the block-device abstraction (see that item
    above) and routed the FS layer's own 8 real `sdhost_read_block`/
    `write_block` call sites (`fs_init`/`fs_append_raw`/`fs_find_
    latest_block_raw`/`fs_compact`/`fs_read_raw` — more than the
    original ~5 estimate once actually counted) through `fs_block_
    read`/`fs_block_write` instead. SDHOST stays the permanent default
    (`fs_state`'s new `fs_block_dev` selector defaults to 0 via `.bss`
    zero-init) — every real FS operation (boot self-tests, shell
    `ls`/`cat`/`write`, `phase4_milestone.py`, `power_yank.py`'s own
    tear-sweep) is unaffected, confirmed by the full existing battery
    staying green unchanged. Then proved USB mass storage genuinely
    works as a second backend THROUGH the same abstraction (not just
    via round 35's own raw primitives): `fs_block_dev_self_check`
    temporarily flips the selector, writes a pattern via `fs_block_
    write`, reads it back via `fs_block_read`, byte-compares, then
    restores SDHOST. Independently verified at the host level again
    (LBA 200 in the backing image holds the real persisted pattern).
    `usb-net` (no BOT interface, selector never touched) confirmed
    unaffected.
    Scope note: this proves the raw block-I/O layer is genuinely
    backend-agnostic, live-verified both ways. It does NOT mean the OS
    can boot/operate its whole filesystem from a USB drive yet — that
    would need selecting the backend before `fs_init()` runs (today
    always SDHOST) and validating the full self-test/normal-operation
    battery against a freshly-attached, unformatted USB device, which
    is a separate, larger step nobody has asked for yet.
  This closes the USB mass storage driver feature's originally-scoped
  work (rounds 33-36). Anything past the scope note above (booting
  from USB, multiple LUNs, etc.) would be new scope, not a remaining
  piece of this item.

- **TCP retransmission + simultaneous open** — `[M-L, ~3-4 rounds]`
  Today's TCP is "a real, useful, correctly-sequenced happy-path
  connection lifecycle, not a spec-complete implementation" (the
  code's own words) — no retransmission timers, no simultaneous-open/
  simultaneous-close, and the advertised window is never consulted.
  Retransmission needs an RTO mechanism that fits this project's
  poll-don't-block design (comparing `scheduler_get_tick_count()`
  deltas against a per-segment retry deadline, not a real async
  timer) plus per-segment retry state. Fully QEMU-testable: packet
  loss can be synthesized directly in a self-test (deliberately not
  delivering a segment `tcp_conn_poll` would otherwise see, then
  checking recovery) — no real network loss scenario or hardware
  needed. Simultaneous-open/close is a smaller, more contained
  addition to the existing state machine once retransmission's own
  timing plumbing exists.

- **FS directory hierarchy + multi-block files + journaling
  hardening** — `[L, ~4-5 rounds]`
  Today's FS is "flat, append-only, checksummed log" — paths are
  opaque strings (`ls` does prefix filtering, not real directory
  listing), and every record is capped at one 512-byte block (464-byte
  payload). Real hierarchy needs path-segment parsing and directory
  metadata; multi-block files need a block-chaining scheme (a
  "next block" pointer per record) so a payload can span more than one
  block. The existing checksum-verified crash recovery and
  compaction/GC are already a basic journal — "hardening" here means
  extending `power_yank.py`'s own crash-consistency sweep to the new
  multi-block case specifically, since a torn write spanning multiple
  chained blocks is a genuinely new crash-consistency risk class the
  current single-block-per-record design never has to handle. Fully
  QEMU-testable — `power_yank.py`'s existing tear-point-sweep
  methodology extends directly, no hardware needed.

## General DMA controller (not scoped — recommendation only, round 35)

User asked about a general "DMA interface for faster stuff" while
this round was growing the USB bulk-transfer buffer. Recorded here
rather than only in chat, since it's a real architectural question
worth a documented answer:

BCM2835 has two genuinely separate DMA facilities. DWC2's own HCDMA
(what this project's USB driver already uses, control and bulk alike)
is peripheral-specific — internal to the USB host controller, already
about as fast as this hardware allows, nothing more to add there. The
SoC's *general-purpose* DMA controller (16 independent channels,
`0x20007000`) is a different, currently-untouched peripheral — the one
actual candidate for "faster stuff" in this codebase today is
`sdhost_drain_fifo_to_buffer`/`sdhost_fill_fifo_from_buffer`
(`boot/sdcard_state.S`), which still move every SD FIFO word via a
plain CPU copy loop.

**Recommendation**: don't build a general BCM2835 DMA-controller
driver speculatively now — same reasoning as not building the
block-device abstraction ahead of a second real backend. Build it
targeted at the SD FIFO path specifically once SD throughput actually
matters for something (e.g. once FS integration below makes real file
I/O throughput visible), verified live under QEMU the same way every
other peripheral in this project has been, rather than as
infrastructure nobody's calling yet.

**NEON**: not available on this project's current target. BCM2835's
ARM1176JZF-S is ARMv6 — scalar VFPv2 floating point only, no SIMD unit
of any kind. NEON (Advanced SIMD) was introduced with ARMv7-A and
needs a Cortex-A-class core; it becomes available "for free" (nothing
to build) whenever the Pi 4/5 port (Cortex-A72/A76, both ARMv8-A)
happens — see `docs/PORTING.md`. Nothing to do for it before then.

## Hardware-in-loop testing (once a real Pi 1B is available)

Every item in this backlog should get as much regression coverage as
QEMU can actually provide before it's considered done — that's the
default, not an exception. Real hardware only enters the loop for
what QEMU's fidelity genuinely can't reach: real USB device timing/
quirks (the mass storage driver above, and anything in the "known
real-hardware-only gaps" section of the Dhruva Feature Ledger —
governor wattage, memory-ordering barriers, the real LAN9512's
hub port-2 behavior), and any future storage backend's real-media
behavior. When a real Pi 1B is connected, treat it as an additional
verification pass on top of the existing QEMU battery, not a
replacement for it — everything QEMU can already catch should still
be caught in QEMU first, keeping the fast local loop as the default
and hardware-in-loop as the final confirmation pass.

## Not yet scoped (flagged in `docs/PORTING.md`, no estimate yet)

- ARMv8-A (Cortex-A72/A76) boot path — `boot/rpi1/boot.S` and
  `context_switch.S` are ARMv6/ARM1176JZF-S-specific (exception
  model, MMU, no EL2/EL1 handling today).
- GIC-based interrupt controller (replaces BCM2835's simple
  interrupt controller — `timer_ic_init` and everything built on it).
- Pi 4/5 timer peripheral differences.

These are prerequisites for a real Pi 4/5 boot, independent of the
storage/USB items above — full scoping deferred until a Pi 4/5 port
is actually started.
